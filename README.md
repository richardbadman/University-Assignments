### Feedback
Below is the feed back obtained for each assignment _(with the exeption of CI311, where no feedback was just supplied)_

#### CI330 - Assignment 1
**DBMS Comparison, followed by chosen best suited DBMS for a given case study**
ER diagram
30/40
ERD is well explained and normalised to eliminate duplication and redundancy. Further recommendation could have been provided. 

Report
9/12
Very well structured. References and citations are required to be provided in Harvard APA format. 

Security
8/12
The justification and discussion of security factors for DBMSs could have been more detailed and justified by relevant references. You could include your analysis within table to justify your points more clearly. 

Variety of languages and currencies
8/12
Very good - the justification of the variety of languages and currencies issues could have been more detailed to include factors that need to be considered within case study. You were required to discuss and provide some justifications within recommendations. 

Value for money
8/12
The justification of differences between cost packages of different DBMSs discussed,

Speed of transaction processing
9/12
You were required to identify transaction requirements in the case study and reference it to the transaction management features of different DBMSs. but this could have been extended.

#### CI330 - Assignment 2
**Data mining algorithm comparison, followed by chosen best algorithm to be used for given case study**
a)The design of a new data warehouse (Star Schema) that could be used for OLAP applications (28/40)

A star schema is presented. There is a fact table and 4 dimensions are related to the fact table. Location as Dimension is required to be provided. The fact tables contains a relevant and useful fact or facts for analysis purposes. Foreign keys are placed but not annotated. You should have provide more clarifications and justifications of your design of the Star Schema. Refer to my further comments/feedback within the report that are provided. 

b) A discussion of the potential for using data mining algorithms to discover information about our existing and potential customers (23/30)

The ways that the business could gain business advantage from the data are discussed but could have been extended. It would be possible to use this report to get some insight/ help make informed decision, however this could have been extended to provide further justifications and concise discussions about the adoption of data mining for this business. It is important to highlight and provide recommendations more explicitly for the organisations. Please also look at my further feedback/comments within the report. 

c)Report (25/30)

The report has satisfactory structure, Word count is ok, 2121 words. The analysis could have been extended and justified, please refer to my details comments within the text. References and in text citations could have been improved, in general you could clarify/justify your discussions better making references to the case study. Please also look at my further feedback/comments within the report.

#### CI346 - Assignment 1
**Programming Languages comparison, in this paper Haskell and Java were compared over various programming paradigms**
A very good report that covers all of the main issues confidently and shows an impressive amount of research and background knowledge in this subject. You are wrong to say that Java provides only parametric polymorphism (which it does, via generics). It also has, and has had since version 1, ad hoc polymorphism through inheritance and method overloading. This is an unfortunate mistake, inheritance being one of the most prominent features of OO style. Despite this error I think the work deserves an A grade. The strongest part of the report is probably the coverage of memory management and garbage collection, which shows an impressive amount of independent research was done and that you learned a lot about the subject.
